# httpt

HTTPT is a simple test server used by the developer-portal team for integration
testing and debugging purpose.

## Available endpoints

### `/status/{statusCode}`

For each status code defined by the HTTP spec, httpt exposes a handler that
will send back this status, along with a text response indicating the status
message. The handlers are designed to respond on any method.

### `/headers`

This handler will print the request headers received by httpt. This can be handy
if you are testing how headers are forwarded by an intermediate proxy. Again,
the handler works with any HTTP method.

- [*] /headers

### `/wait?seconds={count}`

This handler waits for `{count}` seconds before returning a `2OO OK` response.
This can prove usefull if you are looking after an intermediate proxy timeout.
The endpoint catches all methods as well;

- [*] /wait?seconds={count}

### `/john-doe?times={count}`

The john doe endpoint will answer an array of simple payloads that are designed
to weight each 100 bytes. That way, one can test a proxy/client behavior for
different kind of payload. Might prove usefull if you are trying to understand
chunk behavior for an intermediate proxy or to benchmark latencies / debug bandwith
issues. Again, the endpoint handles all HTTP methods.

- [*] /john-doe?times={count}
